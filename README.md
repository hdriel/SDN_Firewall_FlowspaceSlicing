# Software Defined Networks

### Python at Linux (Ubuntu)

## Description

In this project I had the skills with the SDN theme, and I developed a virtual simulator that simulates a network management emulator using this method.

The topology is described in the output of the mininet run that can be seen in screenshots below.

In this project I built two applications:
1. Build the firewall, which I set up in the controller that will talk to the switches that will not communicate between the hosts that are in the existing csv file.
2. Routing of packets according to their content. If the content contains video (eg in a particular port and tcp chips) then we will route them via the lower Slice, otherwise we will route them through the upper slice (as described in the task file).

There is a file in the project that explains how to run the task row by line to run it correctly ..

* Here are screenshots of the project:
